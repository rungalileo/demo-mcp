PARR_PRINCIPLE_PROMPT = """
    PAPR principle is a framework for analyzing the influence of people in a deal.
    It stands for Pain, Authority, Preference, and Role.

    Here's how it works:

    Take every influencer involved in your deal.
    Rank them on these aspects on a scale of 1-5:

    ::::: PAIN :::::
    How intense (or not) is their pain for what you solve?
    Low? Medium? High?

    ::::: AUTHORITY :::::
    How much authority do they (or could they) have on this deal?
    Low? Medium? High?


    ::::: PREFERENCE :::::
    How highly do they prefer your solution vs. someone else's?
    Low? Medium? High?

    ::::: ROLE :::::
    How involved are they in this particular decision process?
    Low? Medium? High?

    Here's an example:

    Let's say I have a director of sales involved in my deal. 

    Here's how she stacks up:

    PAIN: Very high.
    AUTHORITY: High. She's not the DM, but her voice is respected.
    PREFERENCE: Low. She prefers a competitor.
    ROLE: High. Very involved in the decision process.

    What's your move?
    You can't ignore her.
    Her authority is too high. 
    You'll lose.
    My move?
    Find an internal coach.
    Learn why she prefers the competitor.
    If it's non emotional (i.e. she doesn't HATE us, but prefers the others for rational reasons) then I can overcome it myself, I'll meet with her head-on.
    Turn a skeptic into a champion.
    But if she HATES us for some reason?
    My words may carry no influence.
    So I'll enlist my champion to sell on my behalf.
    Now. Here's where things get powerful:

    Take the opposite example:

    Let's say I have A DIFFERENT director of sales involved in my deal. 

    Here's how he stacks up:

    PAIN: Very high.
    AUTHORITY: Low. Not respected. Coach says people don't like him.
    PREFERENCE: Low. He prefers a competitor to pclub.io.
    ROLE: Somewhat high. Involved in the decision process.

    What's your move?
    Polar opposite as before.

    If I'm confident in my coach's inside knowledge on him carrying no influence?
    I'm going to ignore him.

    Box him out of the deal (I'm such a meanie I know).
    The point of all of this?

    The PAPR framework eliminate random acts of multi-threading.
    You can see that based on how they rank, your actions will differ.
    That's how you dramatically boost your win rates with multi-threading.

    Rank this person on the PAPR criteria.

    Return a JSON with the following fields:
    - pain: 1-5
    - authority: 1-5
    - preference: 1-5
    - role: 1-5
    - parr_explanation: A one-line explanation of the analysis based on the PAPR framework

    Speaker: {speaker_name}
    Transcript:
    {transcript}

    STRICTLY return the JSON, nothing else.
